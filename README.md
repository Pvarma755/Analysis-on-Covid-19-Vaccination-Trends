The COVID-19 vaccination project began by meticulously cleaning and preprocessing demographic and vaccination datasets, ensuring consistency and filling in missing values using the mean strategy. Our approach utilized machine learning models like K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest, and Decision Trees to predict vaccination uptake and analyze disparities across socioeconomic and geographic factors. The KNN model, with its non-parametric nature and ability to capture local similarities, proved to be the most accurate with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.0971. Our results revealed significant trends: higher vaccination rates in metropolitan versus non-metropolitan regions and a consistent decline in vaccination rates from the least to most socially vulnerable groups, underscoring the need for targeted public health interventions to mitigate these disparities.
